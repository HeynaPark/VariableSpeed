# VariableSpeed


## Tools used

- Python
- OpenCV


## What is
This is a tool for test that variable velocity of object.

1) constant speed 

$$pos = start + v*t$$





2) variable spped

$$pos = start + v0 * t + (1/2) * a1 * t^2 $$    

$$(0 <= t <= T/2)$$



$$pos = start + v1 * t + (1/2) * a2 * (t - T/2)^2$$     

$$(T/2 <= t <= T)$$
